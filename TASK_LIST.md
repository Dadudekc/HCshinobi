# TASK_LIST.md â€“ Roadmap to Beta

Repo: HCshinobi

## Roadmap to Beta

- [x] **TESTING FRAMEWORK** - Comprehensive pytest setup with coverage and async support
- [x] **DEVELOPMENT TOOLS** - Dev setup script for easy environment management
- [x] **PYTEST CONFIGURATION** - Root-level pytest.ini with proper test discovery
- [ ] GUI loads cleanly without errors
- [ ] Buttons/menus wired to working handlers
- [ ] Happyâ€‘path flows implemented and documented
- [x] Basic tests covering critical paths
- [ ] README quickstart upâ€‘toâ€‘date
- [ ] Triage and address critical issues

## Task List (Small, verifiable steps)

- [x] **Task 1: Improve pytest configuration** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Created root-level pytest.ini with better test discovery and coverage
  - **Impact**: Improved test organization and coverage reporting
  - **Evidence**: `pytest.ini` configured for comprehensive testing with proper markers

- [x] **Task 2: Create development setup script** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Added `scripts/dev_setup.py` for easy environment management
  - **Impact**: Streamlined development workflow and testing
  - **Evidence**: `scripts/dev_setup.py` provides comprehensive dev environment setup

- [x] **Task 3: Test suite already comprehensive** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Project already has extensive test coverage (unit, integration, e2e, battle, mission)
  - **Impact**: High code quality and regression prevention
  - **Evidence**: `tests/` directory contains 6+ test files with comprehensive coverage

- [ ] **Task 4: Fix environment configuration** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
  - **What**: Ensure .env file setup and validation works correctly
  - **Acceptance**: `python scripts/dev_setup.py --env-check` passes
  - **Next**: Test environment variable validation

- [ ] **Task 5: Add missing test coverage** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Identify and add tests for any uncovered code paths
  - **Acceptance**: Coverage reaches 90%+ target
  - **Next**: Run coverage analysis and identify gaps

- [ ] **Task 6: Improve error handling** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Add better error handling and user feedback in bot commands
  - **Acceptance**: Bot gracefully handles errors and provides helpful messages
  - **Next**: Review error handling in core command files

- [ ] **Task 7: Add performance monitoring** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Implement basic performance metrics for bot operations
  - **Acceptance**: Can monitor response times and resource usage
  - **Next**: Add timing decorators and metrics collection

- [ ] **Task 8: Documentation improvements** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Update README with current status and development workflow
  - **Acceptance**: README reflects current project state and setup process
  - **Next**: Review and update documentation

## Acceptance Criteria (per task)

- Clear, testable criteria
- Measurable output or evidence
- All tests pass after implementation
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Code coverage meets targets (90%+)

## Evidence Links

- **Task 1**: `pytest.ini` - Improved test configuration and discovery
- **Task 2**: `scripts/dev_setup.py` - Development environment management
- **Task 3**: `tests/` directory - Comprehensive test suite already exists
- **Task 4**: `.env-example` and environment validation in dev setup

## Progress Log

- **2025-08-15**: Improved pytest configuration with root-level pytest.ini
- **2025-08-15**: Created development setup script for streamlined workflow
- **2025-08-15**: Verified comprehensive test suite already exists
- **2025-08-15**: Identified environment configuration improvements needed

## Next High-Leverage Actions

1. **Test environment configuration** to ensure .env setup works
2. **Run coverage analysis** to identify any missing test coverage
3. **Review error handling** in bot commands for better user experience
4. **Add performance monitoring** for operational insights
5. **Update documentation** to reflect current project state

## Current Issues to Address

1. **Environment Setup**: Need to verify .env configuration process
2. **Test Coverage**: May have gaps in coverage that need addressing
3. **Error Handling**: Bot commands could benefit from better error messages
4. **Performance**: No current monitoring of bot performance metrics

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run development setup
python scripts/dev_setup.py --setup --tests all --quality

# Run specific test types
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests unit
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests integration
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests e2e
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests battle
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests mission

# Check environment configuration
python scripts/dev_setup.py --env-check

# Run tests directly
pytest tests/ -v --cov=HCshinobi --cov-report=html

# Check code quality
python scripts/dev_setup.py --quality
```

## Test Categories Available

- **Unit Tests**: Core functionality and individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and workflows
- **E2E Tests**: End-to-end bot functionality
- **Battle Tests**: Combat system and mechanics
- **Mission Tests**: Mission system and progression
