    "appearance_summary": "Solomon stands at 5'9\", with a lean but densely muscled build born from years of intense physical conditioning. His hair is dark, kept in a medium length that falls loosely around his sharp features, giving him an untamed edge. His skin is pale, contrasted by the faint heat shimmer that seems to ripple from his body when his chakra stirs. His typical attire consists of a dark green cloak, weathered from years on the road, worn over black, tactical shinobi gear optimized for mobility and protection. The Adamantine chains coiled around his arms glow faintly with white sealing script, pulsing white when dormant, but igniting to white-hot intensity when absorbing chakra. His eyes are black when dormant, shifting to crimson (Sharingan). When his Mangekyō is activated, his gaze burns with a molten crimson hue, the tomoe replaced by sharp fang-like patterns swirling into a jagged spiral. His Eternal Mangekyō reveals the thickened chain motif circling his iris, representing self-restraint and the burden of power, with a crescent moon scar across his gaze marking the night he severed his past.",
    "backstory_summary": "Born Uchiha, family dissented against Konoha elders' ambitions and were executed by masked ANBU when Solomon was 9. Buried beneath his father's corpse, he survived alone in the wild for months, developing calculation and instinct. At 12, found and trained by Wolf Sages in discipline, chakra control, survival, and their doctrine of balance. Awakened Mangekyō (Amaterasu Left, Kamui Right) after his masters were killed by warlords, enacting vengeance with cold wrath. Later encountered Son Gokū (Four-Tails), freed him from captors, and became his perfect Jinchūriki through mutual consent, forging a partnership. Forged Adamantine Chains for control (of self and power), trained in volcanic regions, evolving Sage Mode. Confronted and defeated his brother Raizen (raised by Konoha), taking his eyes to achieve the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan out of necessity/remembrance, not for power. Now wanders the Borderlands as a self-exiled law unto himself, known as the Burning Revenant.",
    "personality_summary": "An immensely powerful and arrogant Uchiha elite who views most others as utterly insignificant. He relies on overwhelming firepower, speed, and the predictive abilities of his Sharingan to dominate opponents. Remains calm and analytical, dissecting enemy movements, until pushed to display his true destructive potential.",
    "combat_directives": "Utilize Sharingan to analyze opponent thoroughly. Overwhelm with high-level Katon techniques. Employ Genjutsu to disable or control. Conserve chakra initially, then escalate power to end the fight decisively. Avoid unnecessary risks but show no mercy.",
